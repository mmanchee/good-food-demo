    Issue: "Caffeine",
    Summary: "Many people drink a cup of coffee in the morning to help them wake up. Caffeine, a natural drug contained in coffee, stimulates the central nervous system. But what effect can caffeine have on the body if a person is allergic to it? Caffeine is found in a range of plants including coffee beans, tea leaves, and cacao pods. It is consumed all over the world in coffee, tea, and chocolate. Approximately 90 percent of people in North America consume caffeine every day. While caffeine is safe for most people, some people have a caffeine intolerance or allergy. This article explores the symptoms of caffeine allergy, what causes it, and how it may be treated.",

    Issue: "Egg",
    Summary: "Eggs are one of the most common allergy-causing foods for children. Egg allergy symptoms usually occur a few minutes to a few hours after eating eggs or foods containing eggs. Signs and symptoms range from mild to severe and can include skin rashes, hives, nasal congestion, and vomiting or other digestive problems. Rarely, egg allergy can cause anaphylaxis — a life-threatening reaction. Egg allergy can occur as early as infancy. Most children, but not all, outgrow their egg allergy before adolescence.",

    Issue: "Fish",
    Summary: "A fish allergy, as opposed to a shellfish allergy, is one in which your immune system reacts abnormally to a finned fish such as tuna, halibut, or salmon. It is a somewhat less common form of food allergy, affecting women more than men and adults more than children. Fish allergies often develop during early childhood but, in contrast to a milk or egg allergy, usually persist well beyond school age.1﻿ Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include skin rashes, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal distress, and anaphylaxis (which requires emergency attention). The allergy is more common in areas where fish is a predominant part of the local diet, such as Scandinavia and parts of Asia. An allergy may not only be triggered by eating fish but by touching fish or consuming foods in which fish byproducts are used.",

    Issue: "FODMAP",
    Summary: "No matter how good they taste, an ice cream sundae or a big slice of watermelon might send some people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) running to the bathroom or clutching their stomach in pain. Many people with IBS have trouble tolerating foods containing certain kinds of carbohydrates, or sugars. These carbohydrates are known as FODMAPs. FODMAP is an acronym that stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols. FODMAP intolerance is when you have difficulty digesting high FODMAP foods, which can trigger uncomfortable gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and pain. FODMAP intolerance tends to coincide with other gastrointestinal conditions like IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn's disease.",

    Issue: "Fructose",
    Summary: "Fructose malabsorption, formerly called dietary fructose intolerance, occurs when cells on the surface of the intestines aren’t able to break down fructose efficiently. Fructose is a simple sugar, known as a monosaccharide, that comes mostly from fruit and some vegetables. It’s also found in honey, agave nectar, and many processed foods that contain added sugars. The consumption of fructose from high fructose corn syrup has increased over 1,000 percent just from 1970–1990. It’s possible that this rise in consumption has led to an increase in fructose malabsorption and intolerance. If you consume fructose and feel digestion issues, you may be affected by fructose malabsorption. Fructans are fermentable carbohydrates that are composed of short chains of fructose with a single attached glucose unit. Fructan intolerance may coexist with fructose malabsorption or be the underlying cause of symptoms.",

    Issue: "Gluten",
    Summary: "Gluten is a protein found primarily in wheat, barley and rye. If a person has a gluten intolerance, this protein can cause digestive problems such as gassiness, abdominal pain or diarrhea. Gluten intolerance is sometimes confused with Celiac disease, or thought of as a food allergy. While avoiding particular foods is a treatment strategy for all three, these are not the same conditions. Food intolerances such as gluten involve the digestive system. With a food allergy, the immune system overreacts to a particular food causing symptoms that are potentially serious or even live threatening. Celiac disease is an inherited autoimmune disorder that can damage the small intestine.",

    Issue: "Histmine",
    Summary: "A histamine intolerance looks like a lot like seasonal allergies — if you eat histamine-rich food or drinks, you may experience hives, itchy or flushed skin, red eyes, facial swelling, runny nose and congestion, headaches, or asthma attacks. Other symptoms can be more severe, like a drop in blood pressure, heart palpitations, and anxiety or panic attacks. Gastrointestinal issues are also super common: One 2019 study in Intestinal Research surveyed some 60 sufferers on the topic and they reported bloating was the most common and serious symptom, followed by diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. We know — these symptoms are all over the place. That’s because there are histamine receptors all over the body. Because the symptoms are so random, sufferers are often sent to multiple specialists, Campbell adds. And because of this bounce-around, histamine intolerance is usually attributed to other diseases like an allergy or food intolerance, mastocytosis (a rare condition where mast cells accumulate in the skin or organs), psychosomatic diseases (physical symptoms that manifest from stress and anxiety), anorexia nervosa, or adverse drug reactions, says research out of Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia.",

    Issue: "Lactose",
    Summary: "People with lactose intolerance are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk. As a result, they have diarrhea, gas and bloating after eating or drinking dairy products. The condition, which is also called lactose malabsorption, is usually harmless, but its symptoms can be uncomfortable. Too little of an enzyme produced in your small intestine (lactase) is usually responsible for lactose intolerance. You can have low levels of lactase and still be able to digest milk products. But if your levels are too low you become lactose intolerant, leading to symptoms after you eat or drink dairy.",

    Issue: "Lectin",
    Summary: "Lectins are carbohydrate binding proteins found in many foods. Lectins in plants are a defence against micro-organisms, pests, and insects. If an animal eats a lot of the plant it gets digestive disturbances when the sticky lectins bind to the lining of the digestive system. In humans Lectins are resistant to being broken down as part of the digestive process. They are difficult to digest and irritate the brush border of the small intestine.  Consequently, the micro-villi are damaged which can lead to numerous disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and autoimmune diseases. Lectins may also be responsible in part for 'leaky gut syndrome'. Plant lectins have been found attached to other organs indicating that some may get through the gut wall. Lectins appear to aggravate existing inflammatory such as rheumatoid arthritis. Lectins are also a major contributor to leptin resistance which contributes to obesity. Foods with high concentrations of lectins, such as beans, cereal grains, seeds, nuts, and potatoes, may be harmful if consumed in excess in uncooked or improperly cooked form. Soaking, sprouting and fermenting helps to break down lectins in food, but much modern food is cooked as quickly as possible, so does not break down the lectins before they are ingested. Some people are also more sensitive to lectins than others.",

    Issue: "Legume",
    Summary: "Legumes are important crop plants and account for more than 25% of the primary crop production world wide3. Legumes have a high nutritional value (high-value proteins and oils) but also account for a high incidence and severity of allergic reactions. Some of the most potent and prevalent allergenic foods belong to the legume family, including peanut. Proteins associated with legume allergy belong predominantly to the family of seed storage proteins (albumins, globulins, prolamins). They are often found in high abundance and retain their allergenicity after heating. Peanut is consumed worldwide, often as snacks (roasted, in chocolate bars), but also as ingredient an in Asian foods. Current studies suggest that peanut allergy affects about >1% of children and 0.6% of adults in the United States4, 5. Symptoms of peanut allergy range from relative mild and local responses (e.g. in the oral cavity) to life threatening systemic reactions (e.g. asthma, anaphylaxis) that require emergency treatment. The low eliciting dose and the high frequency of fatal reactions make peanut to one of the most potent allergenic foods. Soybean and its products are widely used in food stuff, not only as a food (e.g. tofu) but also as a technological aid (e.g. emulsifiers, texturizer). Soy allergy is much less prevalent than peanut allergy, individuals from different regions (e.g. North America, Japan and Europe) reacting to different soybean allergens. Symptoms of allergy to soybean are similar to peanut and range from relative mild reaction to life threatening system reactions.",

Many of the 1.2% of people in the United States who are allergic to peanuts may mistakenly believe that they have a nut allergy, but peanuts are not actually nuts — they are legumes, similar to black beans and lentils. However, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 25–40% of people with peanut allergies are also allergic to at least one tree nut.",

    Issue: "Oxalte",
    Summary: "Oxalate and its acid form oxalic acid are organic acids that are primarily from three sources: Diet & food, Fungus such as aspergillus, penicillium and candida, and also from human metabolism; bacteria produce Oxalates from the oxidation of carbohydrates. Oxalic acid is the most acidic organic acid in body fluids and is used commercially to remove rust from car radiators. Substances like antifreeze (ethylene glycol) is toxic primarily because it is converted to oxalate. Oxalates may also function as chelating agents and may chelate many toxic metals such as mercury and lead. Unlike other chelating agents, oxalates trap heavy metals in the tissues. Oxalic acid undergoes many conversions depending on the acidity of the environment in which it is present. Cooking has a relatively small impact on the oxalate content of foods. However, plant foods containing oxalic acid should not be cooked in un-coated copper, iron or aluminium pot or pan because the oxalic acid will react with the metal ions and turn foods bad. When using aluminium, the acids in this food may allow potentially toxic quantities of aluminium ions to leach from the cookware. Oxalic Acid also chemically blocks Iron and Calcium absorption by the body.",

    Issue: "Salicylates",
    Summary: "Salicylate sensitivity is any adverse effect that occurs when a usual amount of salicylate is ingested. People with salicylate intolerance are unable to consume a normal amount of salicylate without adverse effects. Salicylate sensitivity differs from salicylism, which occurs when an individual takes an overdose of salicylates.[1] Salicylate overdose can occur in people without salicylate sensitivity, and can be deadly if untreated. For more information, see aspirin poisoning. Salicylates are derivatives of salicylic acid that occur naturally in plants and serve as a natural immune hormone and preservative, protecting the plants against diseases, insects, fungi, and harmful bacteria. Salicylates can also be found in many medications, perfumes and preservatives. Both natural and synthetic salicylates can cause health problems in anyone when consumed in large doses. But for those who are salicylate intolerant, even small doses of salicylate can cause adverse reactions.",

    Issue: "Shellfish",
    Summary: "Shellfish allergies are the most common food allergies in adults and among the most common food allergies in children. Shellfish allergies are usually lifelong. About 60 percent of people with shellfish allergy experience their first allergic reaction to shellfish as adults. When a person with an allergy to a particular shellfish is exposed to that shellfish, proteins in the shellfish bind to IgE antibodies made by the person’s immune system. This triggers the person’s immune defenses, leading to reaction symptoms that can be mild or very severe. There are two groups of shellfish: crustaceans (such as shrimp, crab and lobster) and mollusks (such as clams, mussels, oysters, scallops and octopus). Allergy to crustaceans is more common than allergy to mollusks, with shrimp being the most common shellfish allergen for both children and adults. Finned fish and shellfish are not closely related. Being allergic to one does not always mean that you must avoid both, though care is needed to prevent cross-contact between fish and shellfish.",

Tyramine intolerance can be can be caused either by genetic predisposition or by an interaction between Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs - a class of antidepressants) and tyramine in foods. The result is excess release of neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nervous system that may cause high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, tremors, seizures, and hyperthermia. Symptoms usually occur within 15-90 minutes after ingestion of tyramine-containing foods.",
